"the plan is to have a plan" -WB

Need to be able to scale quickly so that as many family and friends as possible can survive.  Being able to deal with worst case scenario of food supplies stopping immediatly resulting in looting, killing over drinking water and food, starvation and canabalism.

  - food
  - water
  - weapons

Initial Cache (per safehouse):
  - in designated safehouses
  - dry foods
  - water
  - water purification system
  - medical supplies  
  - hydro equipment
  - weaponry
    - hunting bows and arrows
  - butane soldering irons
  - butane
  - solder
  - generator
  - fuel
  - seed and seedlings
  - 12V DC to 240V AC inverter
  - solar charging system
  - UDPs
    - source code
    - components
      - solder stock
      - wifi stock
      - electic motors stock
      - WB_TODO
  - wifi antenna deployment for UDPs

Key roles:
  - peeps who keep initial caches
  - defence
  - agriculture
  - medical
  - tech
  - jolly coordinator

Defence:
  - we would get attacked by people who want our food
  - some plan to aquire firearms
    - reuse firearms in UDPs
  - plan where to deploy UDPs
    - would contine to build and deploy as society crumbles
  - inner to outer line of defence strategy
  - force  
    - non lethal force
    - force

Agriculture:
  - must be able to grow food inside in a clandestine way to begin with to avoid looters
  - seed
  - rain water collection
  - hydro chemical knowledge
  - move to out door farming once most of the popultion is dead

Medical:
  - WB_TODO

Tech:
  - unmaned defence points (UDPs)
    - quick to build and deploy
    - webcam
    - raspery pi
    - neumatically controlled first person shooter approach
    - pistol or rifle with neumatic trigger
    - laser pointer
    - remote control via wifi
    - auto alert of movement
    - 3 types
      - alarm and flood light (outer perimiter)
      - visible laser and low calibre / single shot (inner perimiter)
      - infrared laser and high round fire rate (last line of defence)      
  - run everything off 12v DC
    
Jolly Coordinator:
  - go out and gather supplies safely and detering robbers and canibals
  - items needed specified by Agriculture and Tech
  - safety provided by Defence
  
Things that will become easy to get:
  - 12V car/truck batteries
  - vehicles
  - agricultre land
  - shelter
  - roofs to collect rain water

Things that will become scarce:
 - food
 - water
 - medical supplies
 
WB_TODO:
  - how to aquire firearms --> 3D print them
